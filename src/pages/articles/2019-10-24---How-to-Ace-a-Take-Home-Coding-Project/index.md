These days lots of companies include a take home project in their interviewing process for software engineers, whether for frontend, backend, or full-stack. This can be a good change of pace to interviews as it gives you a chance to show what you know without someone watching you write code. But it can also be a challenge because the expectations are much higher than an in-person or over-the-phone coding challenge. Some companies request that you take 8 hours or longer to work on a project and of course they're not paying you for this. Recently I've had several take home projects and I've learned a thing or two about what works well for me to succeed on these projects.

## Setting Aside Time
With a recent project I was given, the task seemed relatively simple: fix some existing code and point out some security issues in it. I didn't think it would take long but I wanted to be sure to brush up on my security knowledge so I started doing research. I also was thinking of different ways I could fix some of the code I'd been given. Between this research and trying some of my hypotheses here and there, I spent a lot of mental energy on this project without _dedicating_ much time. I was exhausted from it. I ended up submitting something that didn't even meet requirements, basically because I was over it.

Though it was too late for this project, I realized that I have to block off time to work on a take home project. Here and there won't work, just like it doesn't work in my normal day job. If I don't block off time I'll end up spending a lot of time doing a poor job.

## Scaffolding

### Take aways
- Know your frameworks and libraries beforehand
- Use any frameworks or libraries (within reason) that will speed up your development process

## Requirements
A take home project has limited time but that's not an excuse to skimp on requirements. Unless otherwise stated, you should assume that not meeting requirements means you fail this part of the interview. Before working on the project, make sure you know the requirements well. Read them through a couple times and poke holes in them. Emailing questions to someone might seem like you're bothering them during their day job but you have to put that mentality aside.

### Take aways
- Read the requirements
- Resolve ambiguities
- Read them over again

## Clean It Up

Depending on your coding approach, you may have some code that just works but could be cleaned up. It meets requirements but it's just a take home project that won't be worked on again or maintained so who cares? Well, someone definitely cares and it's the person grading this project. The easier your code is to understand, the more pleasant the grading process is for your potential employer.

### Take aways
- Make sure you adhere to best practices for naming, spacing, etc. If you don't know these, now is a great time to learn them.
- Leave comments, more than you would in your normal code.
- Use a linter or code formatter (preferably the same rules as the company)
