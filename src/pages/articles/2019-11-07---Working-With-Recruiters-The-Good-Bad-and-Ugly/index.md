When I started my most recent job search, I had little motivation to prepare for interviews. I ticked the box on LinkedIn that said I was looking but that was about it. Of course, that meant recruiters started pouring into my inbox. A couple of them were recruiters for specific companies but they mostly were third party recruiters that worked for recruiting agencies. I had heard mostly bad things about recruiters but also some good. Since I was early in my search, I figured it would be a good chance to give one of them a shot.

# Getting started

I responded to their email, answered their phone call, and the next day they had me into their office for a little meet and greet to see what I was looking for and what projects I had worked on in my career. They gave me a rundown of some of the companies they were working with, tried to sell me on some of them, and got my feedback on which of those I might be interested in. They didn't pressure me to apply to any companies, which was nice. Their team seemed pretty nice and I actually knew their team lead from high school (which I'm sure biased me toward him). From there, I was working with a recruiting agency.

# The Good

The best part by far of working with this recruiting agency was that they got me interviews _fast_. I was dragging my feet a little bit about preparing for interviews and this definitely put a fire under my butt to start. Getting phone screens, interviews, and coding challenges scheduled is the easiest way to get motivation to prepare for them. My agency got me interviews quickly and gave me motivation to start getting serious. This in turn made me more prepared for companies I interviewed with independent of this agency.

# The Bad

During this instance of job searching, I actually ended up landing a job with a company that was referred to me by my recruiting agency. I had originally thought the agency would do most of the negotiations for me when the offer came in but when the offer came in and it was time to negotiate, I felt like I was doing the heavy lifting myself. It turned out fine because we reached figures that I was happy with but I also wonder if my compensation would be higher (it almost certainly would) if my recruiting agency weren't getting a cut.

Another downside to working with a recruiting agency is that it adds another level of complexity to the scheduling and coordinating issue because it's simply one more party to involve. Each of the companies I was interested in had their own recruiters that would then work with my recruiting agency. Because of that, there was this weird dynamic where I'd coordinate with the company recruiters on scheduling then the agency recruiter was a little bit out of the loop and would try to play catchup. It was this constant thing where the agency recruiter was emailing me about my schedule and then trying to get the next round of the interview scheduled. Sometimes it seemed like it was just unnecessary work for the agency and they were making these calls for now reason. Which leads me to the ugly...

# The Ugly

Recruiters are known for being pesky and annoying. Well for me, this didn't stop when I started working with them, it had only begun. One of the team members I was working with was nice and calm, playing it cool and working with me at my own pace. But my primary point of contact was more pushy. He called me, sometimes multiple times a day to try to get things scheduled, find out how a phone screen went, or ask about any other companies I was interviewing with that they hadn't set me up with. It felt like it was getting a little out of hand at some points, especially when a company recruiter asked me for my availability for an interview and then the agency recruiter talked to me a couple hours later and asked me for the same availability.

I've seen blog posts about working with several different recruiting agencies and somehow using that to your advantage but I couldn't imagine the coordination headache that would be. One agency was more than enough for me in this regard.

# Recommendations

When all is said and done, I'm happy with the experience I had working with a recruiting agency. I got a lot of interviews very quickly, the team I worked with were pretty nice and seemed like they had my best interest at heart, and I landed a job from it. But there were headaches with coordination, some salesy recruiters, and ultimately a lingering curiousity of how my compensation would be different had I not worked through this company. Most important is that I learned a lot and found out what I did and didn't like about this process. While I enjoyed the experience and definitely saw benefits from it, I don't imagine I would work with another recruiting agency in the future. But only time will tell. I'm happy to answer any specific questions you have about my experience or about the agency I worked with.
