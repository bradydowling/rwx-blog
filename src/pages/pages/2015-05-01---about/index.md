I am a professional software engineer with a focus on UI, frontend, and JavaScript. I love family, basketball, meeting new people, and learning new things.

I started this blog and [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPGv2tVqEt6iBFnnMTjnRBA) as a way of improving how I learn and sharing my learnings with others.
